![Summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15831786/151555942-5fd5e327-911f-4740-8d97-681921459295.png)

I currently work at OS Systems as Software Developer, focusing on the [ShellHub](https://github.com/shellhub-io/shellhub) project, which part of the project is Open Source. ShellHub is a modern SSH server for remotely accessing Linux devices via the command line, using any SSH client, or a web-based user interface. Today I am responsible for the front-end of the project, where I was responsible for suggesting and implementing a code pattern to improve the organization, as well as adding component unit tests and suggestions for improvements to the project. In addition to the front-end, I work on the smaller-scale back-end, which is programmed in Golang, adding new routes and fields in the database models, as well as implementing CRUD. And finally some maintenance on the project's docker.
    
I completed a master's degree in the Graduate Program in Computing at the Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel) (2020). Graduated in Computer Engineering at UFPel (2017). Study and research efforts focused on the areas of Ubiquitous Computing, Context Science, Data Science and Internet of Things.
    
In 2017 I Co-Founded Vantum, Startup which had the idea of an online platform for processing aerial images captured by drones, using cloud resources for data processing.
    
In 2014 I participated in the 2nd Innovative Ideas Contest at UFPEL, presenting a prototype of low-cost software and hardware for the visually impaired, receiving the 3rd place award.
    
I am interested in innovative technologies, in addition to seeking new challenges in different areas. I believe that teamwork is fundamental for personal and professional growth, aiming at share experiences with group members.
